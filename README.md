# ***Mission to Mars: Scraping data with HTML***

## Overview and Purpose of Project
In this project, we are web-scraping and analyzing data for the mission to Mars. We work with HTML elements on the Mars News website to identify id and class attributes to extract information using automated browsing with Splinter and Beautiful Soup, as well as Pandas to scrape data from tables. We are expected to scrape, organize, analyze and visualize the data and answer the following questions:
 
- How many months exist on Mars?
- How many Martian days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
- Which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
- About how many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year?

## Results

After using functions from Splinter, Beautiful Soup and Pandas, we were able to answer the questions. Here are the answers, along with some visuals:

- How many months exist on Mars?
    There exists 12 months on Mars
- How many Martian days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
    There are 1867 Martian days worth of data
- Which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
  The coldest month is the 3rd month, and the warmest is the 8th month
  
  <sub>Minimum Temperatures of the Months in Mars
  
- About how many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year?
    There are about 680 terrestrial days in a Martian year
